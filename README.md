ESP32 and OLED 128x64 3D projection
This project uses the ESP32 S3 microcontroller and a 128x64px OLED display to create a system for generating and manipulating vector lines in 2D and 3D space. 
The main features include:
Vector line generation.
3D projection with adjustable distance.
Object rotation and movement on the screen.
Drawing dittered pictures.
The system allows dynamic interaction with objects by adjusting their position, rotation, and distance on the display. 
The project is compatible with both ESP32 S3 and Arduino Leonardo boards, providing flexibility for different hardware setups.
